This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit type conversion during comparisons.  VBScript's loose typing can cause unexpected behavior when comparing values of different data types. The `bug.vbs` file contains code exhibiting this issue, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with explicit type checking or conversion to ensure reliable comparisons.
